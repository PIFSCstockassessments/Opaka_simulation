# Methods: Recruitment Deviation Time Series Generation

## Overview

We developed stochastic recruitment deviation time series for use in operating model scenarios to evaluate fishery management performance under different recruitment patterns. Two distinct recruitment scenarios were created: (1) normal future recruitment and (2) poor future recruitment representing a 40% decline in mean expected recruitment.

## Historical Recruitment Deviations (Years 1-75)

Historical recruitment deviations were based on estimates from the stock assessment model to preserve potential environmental signals captured during the assessment period. For the first 59 years, recruitment deviations from the assessment were retained with minimal additional variability (σ = 0.01) to maintain historical recruitment patterns while allowing for slight Monte Carlo variation across iterations.

For years 60-75, recruitment deviations were generated using a higher process error (σ_R = 0.15) to reflect increased uncertainty in recent recruitment estimates:

```
R_dev(y,i) = σ_R × ε(y,i) - σ_R²/2
```

where R_dev(y,i) is the recruitment deviation for year y and iteration i, ε(y,i) ~ N(0,1), and the bias correction term (-σ_R²/2) ensures unbiased recruitment in expectation.

## Future Recruitment Scenarios

### Normal Recruitment Scenario (Years 76-125)

For the normal recruitment scenario, future recruitment deviations were generated assuming recruitment would continue following the same stochastic process as the final assessment years:

```
R_dev(y,i) = σ_R × ε(y,i) - σ_R²/2
```

where σ_R = 0.15, maintaining consistency with the variability observed in recent years.

### Poor Recruitment Scenario (Years 76-100)

The poor recruitment scenario was designed to simulate a systematic decline in recruitment over 25 years, reaching 40% below the recent mean by the end of the projection period. This decline was implemented in two phases:

**Phase 1: Gradual decline (Years 76-85)**
A gradual exponential decline was applied over 10 years using a compound decline rate:

```
decline_rate = (0.65^(1/10)) - 1 = -0.042 per year
```

The recruitment multiplier for each year t in the decline period was:
```
M(t) = (1 + decline_rate)^t
```

**Phase 2: Constant low recruitment (Years 86-100)**
Following the decline period, recruitment was maintained at the reduced level:
```
M(t) = 0.65
```

representing 65% of the baseline recruitment (35% decline).

The deterministic recruitment trajectory was calculated as:
```
R_expected(y) = R_baseline × M(y)
```

where R_baseline = 162.4478 represents the mean stock-recruitment curve expectation.

**Stochastic Implementation**
Base recruitment deviations for the poor scenario were calculated as:
```
R_dev_base(y) = log(R_expected(y) / R_baseline) - σ_R²/2
```

Individual stochastic realizations were generated by adding random variation:
```
R_dev(y,i) = R_dev_base(y) + σ_R × ε(y,i)
```

where σ_R = 0.15 to maintain consistency with recent recruitment variability.

## Monte Carlo Implementation

For each scenario, 100 stochastic recruitment trajectories were generated to capture uncertainty in future recruitment patterns. All trajectories used the same underlying deterministic decline pattern but incorporated independent random deviations to reflect natural recruitment variability.

The recruitment deviation matrices were structured as 125 × 100 (years × iterations), enabling consistent comparison across management procedures while maintaining realistic levels of recruitment uncertainty throughout the projection period.

## Model Integration

The generated recruitment deviation time series were integrated into Stock Synthesis operating models by updating the recruitment deviation input vectors in the control files. This approach maintained the assessment model structure while allowing systematic evaluation of management procedure performance under contrasting recruitment scenarios.
